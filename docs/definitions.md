- Menu: `Data/Definitions/Data Types`
- Sub Menus: 
  - `JSON Types`
  - `File Types`
  - `Cenit Types`


### JSON Types

The JSON Data Types correspond to a JSON Schema. To learn more about JSON Schema visit this page http://json-schema.org/

>For JSON types objects, you have the "Actions" options. Go to [Actions of Dashboard section](markdown.md) to have more details.
