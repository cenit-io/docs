# Snippets

The snippets define pieces of code of algorithms and translators. They are located in Compute Menu/Snippets. 

Each snippet could have several versions:

It depends if the snippet is shared for a user. For example, if a snippet is shared under a user, and a tenant of the user has modified the algorithm, data_type or translator related with it, and not directly the snippet, for that element(algorithm, data_type or translator), Cenit will generate you a new snippet version for the tenant.

You can edit the snippet directly here in this view, with the Edit action, but you must keep in mind that in a "snippet" only you will see the code, if the algorithm has a parameter, you must go to the original algorithm to view the parameters. If the father element is a translator, you also should have a general view of the flow where it is located for possibles parameters in the general flow.

If you want to edit into an algorithm, data_type or translator directly a snippet, you can see it in the "Code Warning" section. There you can see if the snippet for a father element has or not a version, or edit it directly by the link.
