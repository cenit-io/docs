# Transforms Menu

In Transforms menu is where you can find the submenus to create the types of translations for your flows.

A Transformation defines a logic for data manipulation.

Data manipulation can occurs in the following main scenarios:

- Importing outside data into Cenit: [Parser Translators](parser.md)

- Converting data already stored in Cenit: [Converter Translators](converter.md)

- Exporting data outside Cenit: [Templates Translators](template.md)

## How to run a tranlator via code

If you need execute a translator via code, or can run the following code:

`Cenit.namespace('A').translator('B').run({ data: data })`

Where `{data: data}` is the hash where the client should get the parameters list what handle in the translator.

## Additional context

In the early beginning of Cenit there was only one model for transformation. We sacrifice a well design and implement an only one model `Translator` to not complicate the Rails Admin navigation menu with a lot of entries. Now that we support index/create actions for multiple sub-models in the same navigation entry itâ€™s time
to correct the past.

The Translator model (Transformation in the future) is now the root of a hierarchy of several models, each model correspond to a combination of the old translator fields type and style. Here is a tree representing such relation:

Template (Export)

* liquid: `Setup::LiquidTemplate`

* xslt: `Setup::XsltTemplate`

* html.erb: `Setup::ErbTemplate`

* js.erb: `Setup::ErbTemplate`

* ruby: `Setup::RubyTemplate`

* pdf.prawn: `Setup::PrawnTemplate`


Cenverter (Conversion)

* liquid: `Setup::LiquidConverter`

* xslt: `Setup::XsltConverter`

* ruby: `Setup::RubyConverter`

* mapping: `Setup::MappingConverter`


Parser (Import)

* ruby: `Setup::RubyParser`


Updater (Update)

* ruby: `Setup::RubyUpdater`


Despite this list, there are other transformations included, which does not match any old translator style, those are `Setup::HandlebarsTemplate` and `Setup::HandlebarsConverter`

Several transformations uses template engines as Erubis (ERB), Liquid, Handlebars and XML Stylesheet. Lets know that when using such transformations they are just template engines
and so they can be used to produce any kind of content type. For example, usually ERB is used to produce HTML content, but it can be used to produce JSON content:

```javascript
{ "name": "<%= source.name %>" }
```

And in the same way a Liquid template can be used to produce HTML

```html
<h1>Name: {{name}}</h1>
```
or JSON

```javascript
{ "name": "{{name}}" }
```

The PRAWN template is an exception, it can just be used to produce PDF content and can only be written in Ruby so far.

XSLT templates should accomplish with the XML Transformation standard.

The converters based on template engines such as Liquid, Handlebars and XSLT, can produce any content type too, as always they can be parsed using JSON, XML or and EDI parser
supported by Cenit. For example, and XML transformation may produce a JSON content like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="2.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform">

 <xsl:output method="text" />

 <xsl:template match="/">
  { "name": "Converted <xsl:value-of select="/A/name" />" }
 </xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>
```

Of course is simpler to use for this case a template like Liquid or Handlebars by writing directly

```javascript
{ "name": "Converted {{name}}" }
```

The converter will detect that the produced content has a JSON format and will parse it to create or update a record.
So a Ruby converter with a code like this

```ruby
target.name = "#{source.name} (converted)"

target.count = source.items.count

target.total_price = source.items.inject(0) { |s, item| s + item.price }
```

can be written as a Liquid converter as follows

```javascript
{
  "name": "{{source.name}} (converted)",
  "count": "{{source.items.count}}",
  "price": "{% eval source.items.inject(0) { |s, item| s + item.price } %}"
}
```

Remember here the `eval` tag is a cenit extension to allow secure Ruby code evaluation into liquid templates.
