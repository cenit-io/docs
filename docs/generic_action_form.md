# Forms Actions

## Add new form element

In Cenit, in each form step you will fill new fields in the creation form and depending on that, existing mandatory fields, which if they are not predefined beforehand, you can have the option to create them in this same view with a pop-up window.

For example, in this form step, if you don’t have a translator before, you can add a new with “Add a new transformation”  button, and follow the process for creating one of this in the same momment where your are filling the principal form. The same way occurs with the events, webhook, data, and others elements that you will need in a form.
